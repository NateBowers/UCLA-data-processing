# UCLA-data


This code was written and tested in python 3.13.1. See requirements.txt for the packages and the versions used.

I *highly* recommend using a virtual enviornment for running this code. I like using [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), but [venv] is easier to setup and use.
